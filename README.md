My project seeks to address issues identified by patients at a medical group office. The goal is to improve the convenience and ease of viewing scheduled appointments, accessing billing and personal information, and viewing information about doctors within the group. The database files contain information for patients, doctors, appointments, and billing within separate tables. I've also designed a user-friendly front-end HTML-based web app form that enables users to query and access data from within the tables.
